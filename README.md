# Design Rationale Lightbulb

This is a Figma plugin/widget that helps designers capture design rationale.

## Development guide

This plugin/widget is built with [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/).\*

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) â€“ v16
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

### Installation guide

- Go to `widget/` folder by `cd widget` and install the widget following the install guide in `README.md`. This will run a widget that appears as a lightbulb and allows people record design rationale with it.

## Installation guide for non-engineers

You will need an IDE to build this plugin/widget. We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/#vscode-section) if you don't know which one to choose.

1. Click the green "<> Code" button to open a dropdown menu. Choose "Download ZIP" and save it to a location of your choice.

2. Unzip the file and open the folder in your IDE.

### Building it

3. Open the terminal in your IDE, type `cd widget` or `cd plugin` and press enter. [Opening terminal in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics)

4. You should see `[~/.../Design_Rationale_Lightbulb/widget] (main) $ ` (or `[~/.../plugin]`) . Now type `npm install` and press enter.

5. The terminal will run for a bit, installing necessary packages. Wait for it to finish.

6. Type `npm run build` and press enter. This will create a `/build` folder under `/widget` (or `/plugin`).
